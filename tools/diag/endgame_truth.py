"""Syzygy-truth endgame corpus and conversion baseline (PLAN 4.9a.1).

The conversion runner (`endgame_conversion.py`) answers one bit per game: did
the engine mate inside the budget. At 100 positions per family that is a
binomial standard error of about 3.5 points, which is why RAR-E06's refit
moved KBN-K by "+4 pp" that nobody can call real. This tool fixes the
resolution problem by grading every strong-side move against the tablebase
instead of every game against the clock, which turns ~100 binary outcomes per
family into thousands of graded decisions.

It separates the four things the endgame audit requires be kept apart:

  theoretical verdict  Syzygy WDL for the position, before anything is played.
  decision quality     per move: did the engine preserve the theoretical win,
                       and did it make DTZ progress toward the zeroing move.
  conversion           did the game actually finish inside the node/ply budget.
  game strength        left to a real match; this tool never reports Elo.

A played draw is statistical evidence, not theoretical truth: only the
`theory_*` fields are truth here, and they come from the tablebase.

Cursed wins matter and are kept distinct. Syzygy WDL 2 is a clean win, 1 is a
win that the fifty-move rule turns into a draw. Downgrading a 2 to a 1 is
exactly the KBN-K failure mode -- 73 of 100 games dying on the fifty-move rule
while the engine still "sees" a win -- so a move that does that is scored as
discarding the win, not as preserving it.

Every position carries its generation seed and is written to the report, so
two runs over the same seed are paired position-by-position and a later
comparison can use a paired test rather than comparing two aggregates.

Example:

  python tools/diag/endgame_truth.py \
      --engine tools/test_engines/rarog-hce-refit-candidate-pext-pgo.exe \
      --syzygy D:/chess/tablebases/syzygy3456 \
