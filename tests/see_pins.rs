//! Phase 7.2 SEE pin-awareness tests, checked against an *independent* legal
//! capture-tree oracle (not a `see_ge`-vs-`see` mirror — lesson 11).
//!
//! The oracle plays the exchange out with real legal moves via
//! `generate_legal_moves` + make/unmake, so pins, pin-ray-legal captures,
//! king-into-defended-square, en passant and promotions are all handled by the
//! move generator itself. `board.see()` must match it on these curated
//! positions. SEE's own material scale (P/N/B/R/Q = 100/320/330/500/900) is
//! replicated here so the two agree on value.
