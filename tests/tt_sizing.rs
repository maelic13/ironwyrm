//! 9.4 regression guard: `Hash` is a contract.
//!
//! Before 9.4, `make_shared` inherited the LOCAL cluster count. A
//! `SharedCluster` is 64 B against `LocalCluster`'s 32 B, so the first
//! multi-threaded search silently allocated twice the `Hash` the user set —
//! and, because the local table was still alive during the conversion, peaked
//! at three times it, at `go` time, mid-game. Nothing reported this; it would
//! have surfaced as swapping and time losses in a tournament and been
//! diagnosed as engine weakness.
